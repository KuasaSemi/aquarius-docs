The repository holds the code and markdown source files for the Aquarius documentation website, which is accessible at [docs.kuasasemi.com](https://docs.kuasasemi.com)

These docs are built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator that makes it easy to create and maintain documentation websites.

## Documentation Issues
If you come across any issues with the documentation or have a feature request related explicitly to it, create a new Jira Ticket and assign to the `Documentation` epic. Before creating a new ticket, check for existing issues to avoid duplication. 

## Workflow
The two suggested workflows are:

- For small changes, use the "Edit this page" button on each page to edit the Markdown file directly on GitHub.
- If you plan to make significant changes or preview the changes locally, clone the repo to your system to and follow the installation and local development steps in [Local setup](#local-setup).

## Conventions

- The front matter for every markdown file should include the `id` and a `title`. `id` will be used to reference the file in `sidebar.js` or `version-x.x.x-sidebars.json` for a specific version.
  ```yaml
  ---
  id: platform-support
  title: Supported Platforms
  ---
  ```

- Use `kebab-case` for file and folder names.
  For example:
  - `/docs/getting-started/ide-extensions.md`
  - `/docs/how-to/use-google-fonts.md`

- Images are important to bring the product to life and clarify the written content. For images you're adding to the repo, store them in the `img` subfolder inside `static` folder. For every topic there needs to be a folder inside `\static\img\` section, for example: `static\img\how-to\use-google-fonts\download-font.png`.
  
  When you link to an image, the path and filename are case-sensitive. The convention is `kebab-case`. `import` should be used to help detect broken images and placed near the top of the document for easier maintenance.

  > Example code for adding an image in markdown file:
  ```
  import ButtonGroup from '/img/button-group.png';
  <img className="screenshot-full" src={ButtonGroup} alt="Button group" />
  ```
  
  Do not include quotes around the `src`'s attribute value.  

## Setup

### Requirements  

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:  

- **Node.js**: Most recent release.
  - If needed, download the latest version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). 
  - Check your Node.js version:  
  ```sh
  node -v
  ```


- **npm**: Installed with Node.js  
  - Verify this with:  
  ```sh
  npm -v
  ```

### Installation  

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:  

```sh
npm install
```

This will download and install all necessary packages required for running the Docusaurus project.

### Running the Development Server
To start the local development server, run:
```sh
npx docusaurus start
```

This will launch the documentation site at `http://localhost:3000/` by default. The site will automatically update as you make changes to the files.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, ensure all dependencies are installed correctly by running:
```sh
npm ci
```
- Check for any missing dependencies or errors in the terminal output.
- Restart the development server if changes are not reflecting.

## Creating a PDF from the Docs site
### Installing docs-to-pdf
To create a pdf from the docs site we can use a free tool: [docs-to-pdf](https://github.com/jean-humann/docs-to-pdf?).

To install this use the following command:
```sh
npm install -g docs-to-pdf
```

It may also be required to add any missing packages:
```sh
npm install -g fs-extra
```

To check `docs-to-pdf` has been installed correctly. Use:
```sh
docs-to-pdf --help
```

### Generating the PDF

Run the site on your local host.

```sh
npx docusaurus start
```

Then run this command to generate the PDF.

```sh
npx docs-to-pdf --initialDocURLs="http://localhost:3000" --contentSelector="article" --paginationSelector="a.pagination-nav__link.pagination-nav__link--next" --excludeSelectors=".margin-vert--xl a,[class^='tocCollapsible'],.breadcrumbs,.theme-edit-this-page" --pdfMargin="80,50,80,50" --coverTitle="Aquarius User Manual - Confidential do not distribute"
```
