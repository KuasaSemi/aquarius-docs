# Hello

## Overview
The current voltage (IV) tracing algorithm is used to automatically trace around
awkward IV characteristics by specifying how to start off the trace and when to stop the
trace. The algorithm will then fill in the points in-between. This is particularly useful
when the curve becomes very steep (such as in the case of avalanche breakdown) in
which case the voltage source driven device becomes very unstable and will not
converge. This algorithm drives one of the device contacts with a variable impedance
current source (a voltage source in series with a resistor), this allows the source to look
more like a current source on vertical sections of the curve. Using this algorithm it is
possible to trace round complete curves that would not ordinarily be possible, such as
the forward break-over characteristics of a thyristor. The algorithm uses the number of
Newton iterations to control the step size.
The IV Trace component is only valid for steady state simulation mode, and a 2D
physical device model must also be present in the circuit. An IV trace should be directly
connected to a device contact. Wires should not be used to connnect the IV trace to a
device contact.
