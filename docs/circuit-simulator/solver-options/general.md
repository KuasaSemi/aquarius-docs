| Name                         | Description                                                 | Unit       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `Minimum Network Resistance` | Specifies the resistance value of the linking resistor used to connect a device to the circuit. | Ohms |
| `Result File Output Type`    | Specifies the type of solution point files which are created by the solver. Options: [Original, Binary, Ascii, None]. | -          |
| `Numerical Precision`        | Specifies the numerical precision used by the solver. In certain simulations, such as reverse bias conditions for wide bandgap materials, higher precision (e.g., Quad Precision) may be necessary to capture small current levels accurately. Options: [Double, Quadruple] | -          |
| `Monitor Solver`             | If enabled the solver output will display more detailed information as simulation progresses. Options: [On, Off] | -          |
