## Overview
This component provides a Zener diode. The behaviour is identical to an ideal diode except when the reverse bias voltage ($-V_D$) is greater than the breakdown voltage ($V_b$). 

### Ideal Case
When $V_D â‰¥ -V_b$ the diode obeys the Shockley Diode Equation:

$$
I_D = I_S (e^{V_D/nV_T} - 1)
$$

where
$I_D$ is the diode current,
$I_S$ is the reverse-bias saturation current and
$V_D$ is the voltage across the diode.

Thermal voltage $V_T$ is defined by $KT/q$ where $K$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature at the junction and $q$ is the electron charge.

The idealty factor $n$ is 1 for an ideal diode. Higher values account for imperfect junctions.

### Breakdown Case
When $V_D < -V_b$ current is given by:

$$
I_D = I_S (e^{V_D/nV_T} - 1) + (V_D+V_b)/R
$$

where $R$ is the breakdown resistance.
