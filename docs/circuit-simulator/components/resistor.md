## Overview
This component provides an ideal resistor between its two terminals. An ideal resistor is a passive, linear component that provides a fixed, temperature-independent resistance to the flow of electrical current. It obeys Ohm's Law, which defines the relationship between voltage ($V$) current ($I$), and resistance ($R$) as:

$$
V = IR
$$
