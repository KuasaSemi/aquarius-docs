# Doping Windows

## Overview
Doping windows are used to specify an implant/diffusion doping profile through a window. The vertical profile maybe a Gaussian, a complementary Error function or a user specified profile. Doping windows can also be projected in the upward or downward directions or even in both directions simultaneously. The doping profile of a device is built-up using region doping and horizontal doping windows, which are summed to give a total doping concentration.

## Usage Instructions
To define a doping window:
1. From the Menu, select Define -> Window -> Doping.

</p>

2. Use your cursor and mouse buttons to define a rectangular doping window.

3. Once the window's shape has been defined the doping window's properties dialog box will appear.  Use this dialog to set the window's properties.

Available materials include Si, SiC, Oxide, Air (more coming soon). The properties of these materials can be fully customised by the user during setup of the device model. There are two general types of semiconductor can be defined, namely:  
- Single Composition (e.g. Si, GaAs, SiC)
- Variable Composition (e.g. AlGaN, AlGaAs).

</div>

### Composition (Coming soon)
After a region has been defined, the user can specify a constant compositional profile over the region. The mole fraction X for a ternary compound and both X and Y mole fractions for quaternary materials can be specified. This command sets a constant values in a specified region.

## Calculation of Vertical Diffusions
### Vertical Gaussian Scaling Factor

$$
y_{fact} = N_0 \exp \left( -\frac{y - y_{offset}}{\sigma_v} \right)
$$

- $N_0$ is the Peak doping concentration, given as the first vertical parameter.
- $y$ is the distance in y direction below/above window.
- $\sigma_v$ is the vertical straddle, given as 2nd vertical parameter.
- $y_{offset}$ is the offset of vertical peak below window, given as 3rd vertical parameter.

### Vertical Erfc Scaling Factor

$$
y_{\text{fact}} = N_0 \operatorname{erfc} \left( \frac{y}{\sigma_v} \right)
$$

- $N_0$ is the Peak doping concentration, given as the first vertical parameter.
- $y$ is the distance in y direction below/above window.
- $\sigma_v$ is the vertical straddle, given as 2nd vertical parameter.
- $y_{offset}$ is the offset of vertical peak below window, given as 3rd vertical parameter.

### Vertical User Defined Scaling Factor

$$
y_{\text{fact}} = y_{\text{user}} \left( {y} \right)
$$

- $N_0$ is the Peak doping concentration, given as the first vertical parameter.
- $y$ is the distance in y direction below/above window.
- $y_{\text{user}} \left( {y} \right)$ is the user profile.
- $\sigma_v$ is the vertical straddle, given as 2nd vertical parameter.
- $y_{offset}$ is the offset of vertical peak below window, given as 3rd vertical parameter.

## Calculation of Lateral Diffusions
The lateral extent of the profile is controlled by the point types, and the lateral choice.

### Lateral Rotation Scaling Factor
The lateral rotation scaling factor defines a series of elliptical contours for the lateral profile. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 represents a circular shape. Typically, values between 0.5 and 0.8 are used.

For $x$ outside window:

$$
x_{\text{fact}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{x - x_w}{r}\right)^2 + y^2}
$$

Otherwise:

$$
x_{\text{fact}} = 1
$$

- $x$ is the current x coordinate.
- $x_w$ is either window edge.
- $y$ is the distance in y direction below/above window.
- $r$ is the Radial reduction factor, given as 1st lateral parameter.

### Lateral Erfc Scaling Factor
If both points are window points:

$$
x_{\text{fact}} = \operatorname{erfc}{\left(\frac{x - x_y}{\sigma_l}\right) - \operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{x - x_l}{\sigma_l}\right)  }
$$

If only a left point is a window point:

$$
x_{\text{fact}} = -\operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{x - x_l}{\sigma_l}\right)^2
$$

If only a right point is a window point:

$$
x_{\text{fact}} = \operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{x - x_y}{\sigma_l}\right)^2
$$

If neither point is a window point:

$$
x_{\text{fact}} = 1
$$

- $y$ is the distance in y direction below/above window.
- $\sigma_l$ is the lateral straddle, given as 1st lateral parameter.

A window point is defined as...?

## Total Doping
The total doping at point is defined as:
$$
N(x, y) = x_{\text{fact}} \cdot y_{\text{fact}}
$$
