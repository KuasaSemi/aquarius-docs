# General Introduction

## Overview

Aquarius is a mixed mode 2D semiconductor process, device and circuit simulator for the desktop PC. With Aquarius you can create complex physical models of semiconductor devices and build sophisticated circuits with the minimum of effort in a powerful, yet easy to use TCAD environment. With access to the full range of device physics (including electro-thermal modelling), Aquarius provides a reliable and cost effective way to evaluate the performance and characteristics of semiconductor devices before committing to fabrication.

Aquarius is composed of three highly integrated modules:

### [Device Editor](/category/device-editor)
Used to define the physical attributes of a two-dimensional semiconductor device structure. The definition of the device may be imported from a fabrication process model or defined directly without reference to a process model. The device model is then conveyed to the circuit simulator module for electrothermal simulation in the context of a circuit. 

### [Circuit Simulator](/category/circuit-simulator)
Used to define the circuit and bias conditions for the device, it also solves the device and circuit equations, saving the results to a disk file.

### [Results Visualiser](/category/results-visualiser)
Used to view the results of a simulation and plot graphs of various physical properties. Graphs can be saved to obtain hard copies.
