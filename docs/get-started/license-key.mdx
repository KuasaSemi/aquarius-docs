# License Key

## Overview

A license key is required to activate and use the full features of Aquarius. Each key is unique and tied to a specific user or organisation.

## Obtaining a License Key

After successful payment, you will receive the license key via email.

## Activating Your License Key

Once you have obtained your license key, activate it by following these steps:

Open [Your Software Name]. After the first installation, the software will be unlicensed. A window will pop up requesting a license key be entered.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/license-key/license-key-1.png')}/>
</p>

Your license key will be in the format XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. Enter it into the text box and activate the license.

<p align="center">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/license-key/license-key-2.png')}/>
</p>

If the key is valid, the 'OK' button will be enabled. Click OK to continue.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the license file, try deleting the local License.key file from your system. You can find it at:

```sh
{SystemDrive}:/Users/{UserName}/AppData/Local/LicenseSpring/{ProductCode}
```
After deleting the file, follow the steps above to reactivate the license key.
