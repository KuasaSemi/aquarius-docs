# PN diode, depletion width.

## 1. Overview

In this section, the relationship between the applied voltage and the depletion width of the PN diode produced under **Examples** will be explored. As explained under `Examples` →  `PN diode`, A PN junction diode has three regions: the n-region, the p-region and the depletion region.

The depletion region width is dependent on the applied voltage across the diode. The depletion width equation is derived from using Gauss’s law for electric flux. ##insert derivation link, will be written straight on markdown## The derivation assumes that the free electrons from the n-type region have diffused into the holes of the p-type region producing a potential difference. This potential difference is known as the **Built-in potential**. Calculations are based off the interactions between the positive and negative ions produced by the diffusion process.

An analytical model was produced to display the relationship between the applied voltage across the diode and the depletion width. The goal here being to understand the physics behind a PN junction diode.
