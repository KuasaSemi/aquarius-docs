# Resistor

## Overview
This component provides an ideal resistor between its two terminals. An ideal resistor is a passive, linear component that provides a fixed, temperature-independent resistance to the flow of electrical current. It obeys Ohm's Law, which defines the relationship between voltage ($V$) current ($I$), and resistance ($R$) as:

$$
V = IR
$$

## Usage Instructions

To add a resistor to the circuit:

1. Click the resistor icon in the Component toolbar.
2. While holding down the left mouse button, drag the resistor to the desired location on the canvas.  
3. Release the mouse button to place the component.
4. Double-click the resistor to open the properties window.
5. Adjust the Name and Resistance values as needed.
4. Click `OK` to apply the changes and close the properties window.
